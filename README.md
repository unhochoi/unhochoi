### Projects

- **Edge Accelerator Monitor**
    - Edge Accelerator Monitor is a Kubernetes cluster configuration project that extracts various hardware information of Edge Accelerator and automatically labels it and provides it to users.
    - In this project, I was responsible for extracting the edge accelerator hardware information.
    - This project has evolved into a paper titled "Accelerator-Aware Kubernetes Scheduler for DNN Tasks on Edge Computing Environment".
- **Cloud-native Deep Learning Inference Application**
    - Cloud-native Deep Learning Inference Application was a project to provide Samsung Electronics' cloud architect training course.
    - It was a project to configure Deep Learning Inference Application in Cloud-native in Classic, Container, and Serverless versions.
    - In that project, I was responsible for implementing a container-based Deep Learning Inference Application.
- **SEMO (Security Monitoring Platform)**
    - As the amount of network traffic increases in the age of information, the role of security control in the security field is becoming more important.
    - Therefore, the Security Monitoring Platform (SEMO) is a project designed to help security controllers update automatic processing rules.
    - Our team has developed a function that receives the collected log data, determines whether it is spy and false through deep learning, analyzes it, and displays the analysis results to users through the web.
    - In the project, I was in charge of building a web server and linking the server-model
